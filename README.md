# EIPC_webTest
2d fluid simulation test for EIPC website.

Feature Goals:

Implemented:
- particle field that moves in response to cursor movement
- partical field initializes to "random" flow state on load/reload
- particle field lerps back to initial state after mouse interaction

In Development:
- inital state based on some sort of noise to approximate "air currents", maybe perlin?
